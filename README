How to set up the rasta-web application. 

1. go into the rasta project and run rasta_server.py

    cd ../rasta-project/python
    python3 rasta_server.py

This will run the http server and listen on port 4000
(paths may differ since this is an independant project)

2.1 Rasta-web, local set up (e.g. for testing purposes, otherwise see 2.2) 

Edit the file

    src/frontend/js/app.js

and set the URL variable to

    var URL='http://localhost:4000/'

2.2 Rasta-web production set-up (e.g. when rasta_server.py is running behind a firewall)

You need to set up the php proxy to forward http request to the rasta server.
Here how to do it: 

First step: edit the file

    src/frontend/app.js

and set the URL variable to
    
    var URL='../backend/php/ajax.php'

Second set: edit the file

    backend/php/ajax.php

and set the $URL variable to :

    $URL= 'http://localhost:4000/';

Where localhost is the address of the rasta server (localhost if rasta server is running on the webserver.) 

3 Access Rasta-web

By accessing the file http://server/rasta_web/src/frontend/index.html from a web browser.
where server is the dns of your http server

NOTE for local set-ups: You may need to start an http server if you don't have one already running.
You can do this by running the following commands

    cd rasta-web/src/frontend
    python3 -m http.server 8000

Then you can check the results by accessing this url in your browser: http://localhost:8000
